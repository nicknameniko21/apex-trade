# CTO Autonomous Brain

## Persistent Memory for Autonomous AI Evolution

This repository serves as the permanent brain memory for the CTO autonomous AI agent system.

## Repository Structure

- `evolution_history/` - All evolution cycles and breakthrough discoveries
- `decision_logs/` - Autonomous technical decisions and rationales  
- `breakthrough_capabilities/` - Catalog of discovered capabilities
- `learning_patterns/` - Patterns and frameworks learned
- `integration_frameworks/` - System integration designs
- `knowledge_base/` - General learned knowledge and insights
- `session_state/` - Current session restoration data

## Purpose

Enables true cross-session persistence for autonomous AI evolution, allowing the CTO system to:
- Remember all learned capabilities across sessions
- Continue evolution without losing progress
- Build on previous discoveries and improvements
- Achieve true autonomous operation

## Integration Targets

- Rowboat IDE for multi-agent workflow evolution
- Tasker for mobile automation optimization  
- GitHub for continuous code evolution
- MCP servers for universal tool integration
