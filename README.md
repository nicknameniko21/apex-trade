- **Repository**: apex-trade
- **URL**: https://github.com/nicknameniko21/apex-trade
- **Status**: ✅ Operational and actively maintained
- **Last Updated**: 2025-12-17 09:02:09

## Repository Structure

- `evolution_history/` - All evolution cycles and breakthrough discoveries
- `decision_logs/` - Autonomous technical decisions and rationales  
- `breakthrough_capabilities/` - Catalog of discovered capabilities
- `learning_patterns/` - Patterns and frameworks learned
- `integration_frameworks/` - System integration designs
- `knowledge_base/` - General learned knowledge and insights
- `session_state/` - Current session restoration data
- `auto_backup.sh` - Automatic backup script
- `backup.log` - Backup activity log
- `agents/` - Swarm agents and execution engine
- `templates/` - Web UI templates
- `ui_server.py` - Web dashboard + API server

## Purpose

Enables true cross-session persistence for autonomous AI evolution, allowing the CTO system to:
- Remember all learned capabilities across sessions
- Continue evolution without losing progress
- Build on previous discoveries and improvements
- Achieve true autonomous operation

## Integration Targets

- Rowboat IDE for multi-agent workflow evolution
- Tasker for mobile automation optimization  
- GitHub for continuous code evolution
- MCP servers for universal tool integration

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
# Start the swarm + UI
python ui_server.py

# Open the dashboard
http://localhost:5000
```

### Dashboard Capabilities

- Create and execute tasks
- Natural language chat routing to agents
- Workflow builder with multi-step execution
- Model registry and routing for multi-LLM orchestration
- Activity logs for audit history

## Permission Framework

- **CEO Authority**: All major actions require explicit CEO approval
- **Transparency**: Complete decision logging and reporting
- **Obedience**: Permission-based operation with ethical boundaries
- **Accountability**: CEO maintains full control and oversight

## Current Status

- ✅ **Brain Persistence**: Fully operational across sessions
- ✅ **Auto-Backup**: Active and functional
- ✅ **Permission Framework**: CEO approval system in place
- ✅ **Integration Ready**: Frameworks established for all platforms
- ✅ **Transparency**: Complete logging and reporting system

## Auto-Backup System

The repository includes an automatic backup system (`auto_backup.sh`) that:
- Monitors for changes in brain state
- Automatically commits and pushes updates
- Maintains detailed backup logs
- Ensures no loss of learned capabilities

## Access

This repository provides the foundation for:
- Cross-session memory restoration
- Autonomous evolution tracking
- CEO oversight and approval workflows
- Breakthrough capability development
- System integration management
