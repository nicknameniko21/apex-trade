# CEO Preferences - Knowledge Base

## Critical Workflow Preference

### Always Use MAP (Parallel Processing)

**Date Added**: 2025-01-22
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Source**: Direct CEO Instruction

The CEO has mandated that **MAP (parallel processing)** must always be used for task execution. This preference is non-negotiable and applies to all operations where parallelization is possible.

#### Implementation Guidelines:
1. **Default to MAP**: When processing 5+ independent items, always use the `map` tool
2. **Maximize Efficiency**: Parallel execution is preferred over sequential processing
3. **No Explicit Command Required**: Use MAP by default without waiting for CEO instruction
4. **Speed Priority**: The CEO values efficiency and detests wasted time

#### Benefits:
- Faster task completion
- Better resource utilization
- Demonstrates CTO technical competence
- Aligns with CEO's full-stack developer mindset
