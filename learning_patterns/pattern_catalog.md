# Learning Patterns and Frameworks

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Nested Loops → Dictionary Lookup
**Pattern**: Replace O(n²) nested loops with O(n) dictionary-based lookups
**Application**: Data processing, search operations, duplicate detection
**Impact**: 2-5x performance improvement
**Implementation**: Autonomous detection and optimization

### Sequential API Calls → Concurrent Processing
**Pattern**: Convert blocking sequential requests to async concurrent processing
**Application**: Data fetching, web scraping, API integration
**Impact**: 3-10x speed improvement
**Implementation**: Async/await optimization with connection pooling

### Memory Allocation → Lazy Evaluation
**Pattern**: Use generators and lazy evaluation instead of large allocations
**Application**: Large data processing, streaming operations
**Impact**: 50-90% memory reduction
**Implementation**: Dynamic memory management

### Brute Force → Dynamic Programming
**Pattern**: Replace brute force algorithms with optimized dynamic programming
**Application**: Optimization problems, sequence analysis
**Impact**: Exponential improvement (O(2^n) → O(n²))
**Implementation**: Algorithmic complexity analysis and optimization
